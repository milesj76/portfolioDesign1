# portfolioDesign1
A recreation of a portfolio design found on W3Schools.

Made 9/13/17 by Miles Burke

The goal with this was to recreate a portfolio with responsive design. This site was made (as I intended) completely from scratch using HTML and CSS. I wanted to make sure I could figure out how to use the fundamentals of these languages before I started using other frameworks and languages. This was also my first time using media queries and the site should look passable at all window sizes. In my future projects, I will probably strictly use SASS for my styling, begin to incorporate jQuery and perhaps venture into building with Bootstrap. Please feel free to send me suggestions or notes about the site. I'm aware that it's far from professional so please do not hesitate to give me constructive critiques for my eduactional advancement. I appreciate you for taking the time to read this!
